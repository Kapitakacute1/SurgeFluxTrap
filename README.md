# SurgeFluxTrap

## Objective
Develop a Drosera-compatible smart trap that:

- Monitors microvolatility in Ethereum base fees between blocks,
- Uses collect() and shouldRespond() as per Drosera trap standard,
- Triggers responses on notable basefee fluctuations (>1.5%),
- Alerts the network via a dedicated transmitter contract.

## Problem
In a highly dynamic Ethereum network, rapid but subtle basefee fluctuations often signal congestion waves, MEV activity, or abnormal validator behavior.
Such shifts may not break protocols outright but can degrade performance, distort fee estimations, or bias economic mechanisms relying on gas predictions.

Failure to detect these flux patterns can affect:

- Rollup sequencers or bundlers,
- Protocols estimating execution costs,
- On-chain economic models sensitive to basefee.

## Solution
SurgeFluxTrap continuously observes the block.basefee and reacts when it changes more than 1.5% between consecutive blocks — a common threshold hit every few blocks in active networks.
Once a flux is detected, the trap emits a response through a dedicated relay contract, enabling fast on-chain or off-chain reactions.

This setup ensures high-frequency detection of gas dynamics while minimizing false positives.

## Trap Logic

**Contract: SurgeFluxTrap.sol**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface ITrap {
    function collect() external view returns (bytes memory);
    function shouldRespond(bytes[] calldata data) external pure returns (bool, bytes memory);
}

/// @title SurgeFluxTrap — triggers on subtle basefee shifts
contract SurgeFluxTrap is ITrap {
    function collect() external view override returns (bytes memory) {
        return abi.encode(block.basefee);
    }

    function shouldRespond(bytes[] calldata data) external pure override returns (bool, bytes memory) {
        if (data.length < 2) {
            return (false, bytes("Insufficient samples"));
        }

        uint256 current = abi.decode(data[0], (uint256));
        uint256 previous = abi.decode(data[1], (uint256));

        uint256 delta = current > previous ? current - previous : previous - current;
        uint256 threshold = previous / 66; // ~1.5%

        if (delta > threshold) {
            return (true, abi.encode("Basefee flux >1.5%"));
        }

        return (false, bytes("Stable basefee"));
    }
}
```

## Response Contract

**Contract: FluxBeaconTransmitter.sol**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract FluxBeaconTransmitter {
    event FluxAlert(bytes payload);

    function transmit(bytes calldata payload) external {
        emit FluxAlert(payload);
    }
}
```


## Deployment & Setup

Deploy contracts with Foundry:

bash

```solidity
forge create src/SurgeFluxTrap.sol:SurgeFluxTrap \
  --rpc-url https://ethereum-hoodi-rpc.publicnode.com \
  --private-key 0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Update `drosera.toml`:

[traps.surge_flux]

```solidity
path = "out/SurgeFluxTrap.sol/SurgeFluxTrap.json"
response_contract = "0x35D701B69C0852063f8c532bcA63352eCd31cA06"
response_function = "transmit"
```

Apply:

bash

```solidity
DROSERA_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY drosera apply
```

## Testing the Trap
1. Deploy both contracts.
2. Configure Drosera with the updated .toml.
3. Observe logs after a few blocks.
4. Look for:

- shouldRespond: true on >1.5% basefee shift,
- FluxAlert event emitted from transmit().

## Ideas for Extension

Add average basefee window to detect trends,

Introduce gaslimit or other block metrics,

Forward alerts to off-chain systems or automated responders.
